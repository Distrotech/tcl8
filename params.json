Introduction\r\n---------------\r\nTcl provides a powerful platform for creating integration applications that\r\ntie together diverse applications, protocols, devices, and frameworks.\r\nWhen paired with the Tk toolkit, Tcl provides the fastest and most powerful\r\nway to create GUI applications that run on PCs, Unix, and Mac OS X.\r\nTcl can also be used for a variety of web-related tasks and for creating\r\npowerful command languages for applications.\r\n\r\nTcl is maintained, enhanced, and distributed freely by the Tcl community.\r\nThe home for Tcl/Tk releases and bug/patch database is on SourceForge:\r\n\r\n\thttp://tcl.sourceforge.net/\r\n\r\nwith the Tcl Developer Xchange hosted at:\r\n\r\n\thttp://www.tcl.tk/\r\n\r\nTcl is a freely available open source package.  You can do virtually\r\nanything you like with it, such as modifying it, redistributing it,\r\nand selling it either in whole or in part.  See the file\r\n\"license.terms\" for complete information.\r\n\r\n2. Documentation\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nExtensive documentation is available at our website.\r\nThe home page for this release, including new features, is\r\n\thttp://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/8.5.html\r\n\r\nDetailed release notes can be found at the file distributions page\r\nby clicking on the relevant version.\r\n\thttp://sourceforge.net/projects/tcl/files/\r\n\r\nInformation about Tcl itself can be found at\r\n\thttp://www.tcl.tk/about/\r\n\r\nThere have been many Tcl books on the market.  Many are mentioned in the Wiki:\r\n\thttp://wiki.tcl.tk/_/ref?N=25206\r\n\r\nTo view the complete set of reference manual entries for Tcl 8.5 online,\r\nvisit the URL:\r\n\thttp://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/\r\n\r\n2a. Unix Documentation\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nThe \"doc\" subdirectory in this release contains a complete set of\r\nreference manual entries for Tcl.  Files with extension \".1\" are for\r\nprograms (for example, tclsh.1); files with extension \".3\" are for C\r\nlibrary procedures; and files with extension \".n\" describe Tcl\r\ncommands.  The file \"doc/Tcl.n\" gives a quick summary of the Tcl\r\nlanguage syntax.  To print any of the man pages on Unix, cd to the\r\n\"doc\" directory and invoke your favorite variant of troff using the\r\nnormal -man macros, for example\r\n\r\n\t\tditroff -man Tcl.n\r\n\r\nto print Tcl.n.  If Tcl has been installed correctly and your \"man\" program\r\nsupports it, you should be able to access the Tcl manual entries using the\r\nnormal \"man\" mechanisms, such as\r\n\r\n\t\tman Tcl\r\n\r\n2b. Windows Documentation\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nThe \"doc\" subdirectory in this release contains a complete set of Windows\r\nhelp files for Tcl.  Once you install this Tcl release, a shortcut to the\r\nWindows help Tcl documentation will appear in the \"Start\" menu:\r\n\r\n\tStart | Programs | Tcl | Tcl Help\r\n\r\n3. Compiling and installing Tcl\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nThere are brief notes in the unix/README, win/README, and macosx/README about\r\ncompiling on these different platforms.  There is additional information\r\nabout building Tcl from sources at\r\n\r\n\thttp://www.tcl.tk/doc/howto/compile.html\r\n\r\n4. Development tools\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nActiveState produces a high quality set of commercial quality development\r\ntools that is available to accelerate your Tcl application development.\r\nTcl Dev Kit builds on the earlier TclPro toolset and provides a debugger,\r\nstatic code checker, single-file wrapping utility, bytecode compiler and\r\nmore.  More information can be found at\r\n\r\n\thttp://www.ActiveState.com/Tcl\r\n\r\n5. Tcl newsgroup\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nThere is a USENET news group, \"comp.lang.tcl\", intended for the exchange of\r\ninformation about Tcl, Tk, and related applications.  The newsgroup is a\r\ngreat place to ask general information questions.  For bug reports, please\r\nsee the \"Support and bug fixes\" section below.\r\n\r\n6. Tcl'ers Wiki\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nA Wiki-based open community site covering all aspects of Tcl/Tk is at:\r\n\r\n\thttp://wiki.tcl.tk/\r\n\r\nIt is dedicated to the Tcl programming language and its extensions.  A\r\nwealth of useful information can be found there.  It contains code\r\nsnippets, references to papers, books, and FAQs, as well as pointers to\r\ndevelopment tools, extensions, and applications.  You can also recommend\r\nadditional URLs by editing the wiki yourself.\r\n\r\n7. Mailing lists\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nSeveral mailing lists are hosted at SourceForge to discuss development or\r\nuse issues (like Macintosh and Windows topics).  For more information and\r\nto subscribe, visit:\r\n\r\n\thttp://sourceforge.net/projects/tcl/\r\n\r\nand go to the Mailing Lists page.\r\n\r\n8. Support and Training\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nWe are very interested in receiving bug reports, patches, and suggestions\r\nfor improvements.  We prefer that you send this information to us via the\r\nbug form at SourceForge, rather than emailing us directly.  The bug\r\ndatabase is at:\r\n\r\n\thttp://tcl.sourceforge.net/\r\n\r\nThe bug form was designed to give uniform structure to bug reports as\r\nwell as to solicit enough information to minimize followup questions.\r\n\r\nWe will log and follow-up on each bug, although we cannot promise a\r\nspecific turn-around time.  Enhancements, reported via the Feature\r\nRequests form at the same web site, may take longer and may not happen\r\nat all unless there is widespread support for them (we're trying to\r\nslow the rate at which Tcl/Tk turns into a kitchen sink).  It's very\r\ndifficult to make incompatible changes to Tcl/Tk at this point, due to\r\nthe size of the installed base.\r\n\r\nThe Tcl community is too large for us to provide much individual support\r\nfor users.  If you need help we suggest that you post questions to\r\ncomp.lang.tcl.  We read the newsgroup and will attempt to answer esoteric\r\nquestions for which no one else is likely to know the answer.  In addition,\r\nsee the following Web site for links to other organizations that offer\r\nTcl/Tk training:\r\n\r\n\thttp://wiki.tcl.tk/training\r\n\r\n9. Tracking Development\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nTcl is developed in public.  To keep an eye on how Tcl is changing, see\r\n\thttp://core.tcl.tk/\r\n\r\n10. Thank You\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nWe'd like to express our thanks to the Tcl community for all the\r\nhelpful suggestions, bug reports, and patches we have received.\r\nTcl/Tk has improved vastly and will continue to do so with your help.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
